# MIDI 2 Hydrogen

A free macOS utility for conversion of the MIDI files into Hydrogen Drum Machine song (h2song). It converts MIDI into the song - a sequence of patterns. It can detect the pattern duplicates. The MIDI file should have just one track. Currently, only GMRockKit is supported. The application uses the AudioKit library.
